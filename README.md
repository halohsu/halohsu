你好，我创办了 WecomZ 量化对冲基金。

WecomZ 是利用古老的东方智慧与先进的计算机科学相结合进行对冲和套利的自营基金。我们实盘的主要品种有：加密货币、期货、价差合约、期权和指数。我们不对中国A股标的符号和东南亚地区相关标的符号进行投资。数千年的文明和先进的计算机科学滋养 WecomZ 茁壮成长。

WecomZ 正在推进第二代实盘交易和智能回溯测试系统，利用大型的 Dell Power Edge(Xeon) 集群和 Dell Power Vault(NVMe) 集群运行，Windows Server 2025 DataCenter 和 RedHat Enterprise Linux 是我们的主要操作系统和目标兼容性。我们二代系统在 Arista 的基础上，也支持了 NVIDIA InfiniBand 网络，RoCE 不是我们的目标，因为它存在不完整的大型商业合同级支持。

WecomZ 是一家 BVI 公司。我们正在尝试推出可以私人募集的产品与您共同承担风险和利润。

Hey, I founded WecomZ, a quantitative hedge fund.

WecomZ is a proprietary hedge fund that integrates ancient Eastern wisdom with advanced computer science for hedging and arbitrage strategies. Our live trading focuses on cryptocurrencies, futures, spread contracts, options, and indices, while we explicitly avoid investments in Chinese A-share equities or Southeast Asian-related securities. Thousands of years of civilization and cutting-edge computational science have fostered the growth of WecomZ.

We are advancing our second-generation live trading and intelligent backtesting systems, powered by large-scale Dell Power Edge (Xeon) clusters and Dell Power Vault (NVMe) storage clusters. Our primary operating environments include Windows Server 2025 DataCenter and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, with full compatibility ensured for these platforms. Building on Arista’s infrastructure, our system now supports NVIDIA InfiniBand networking. Reverse Overcoming Ethernet (RoCE) is excluded from our roadmap due to insufficient large-scale commercial-grade support and incomplete contractual safeguards.

As a BVI-based entity, WecomZ is presently developing privately raised investment products to partner with clients in sharing risks and rewards.
